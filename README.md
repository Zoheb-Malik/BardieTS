## üí° Examples Of Use

### Asking A Simple Question

#### Typescript Usage -

To use BardieTS in typescript, create a file named `index.ts` in your project's root directory and make sure you have `ts-node` (or equivalent) installed.
Once you have an `index.ts` file with the contents below, execute `ts-node index.ts` in your terminal.

```typescript
import BardieTS from "bardieTS";

const bard = new BardieTS();

const options = {
  ask: "Keep it simple... What is Google Bard?"
};

async function askQuestion() {
  try {
    const result = await bard.question(options);
    console.log(result.content);
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
};

askQuestion();
```

#### Javascript Usage -

To use BardieTS in javascript, create a file named `index.js` in your project's root directory. You should already have `node` installed.
Once you have an `index.js` file with the contents below, execute `node index.js` in your terminal.

```javascript
const BardieTS = require("bardie-ts");

const bard = new BardieTS();

async function askQuestion() {
  const result = await bard.question({ ask: "Keep it simple... What is Google Bard?"});
  console.log(result.content);
}

askQuestion();
```

#### Response:

> "In a nutshell, I'm Google's AI helper you can chat with.
I can answer your questions, generate creative text formats, and help you with various tasks in a simple and informative way.
Think of me as a friendly AI companion ready to assist you anytime!"

### Asking A Question With Image Input

#### Typescript Usage -

```typescript
import BardieTS from "bardie-ts";

const bard = new BardieTS();

const options = {
  ask: "Keep it simple... What is this image?",
  image: "https://i.imgur.com/OgoPlnf.png"
};

async function askQuestionWithImage() {
  try {
    const result = await bard.question(options);
    console.log(result.content);
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
};

askQuestionWithImage();
```

#### Javascript Usage -

```javascript
const BardieTS = require("bardie-ts");

const bard = new BardieTS();

async function askQuestionWithImage() {
  const result = await bard.question({
    ask: "Keep it simple... What is this image?",
    image: "https://i.imgur.com/OgoPlnf.png"
  });
  console.log(result.content);
}

askQuestionWithImage();
```

#### Response:

> "The image you sent me is the logo of Bard, a large language model chatbot developed by Google AI.
The logo consists of two colorful stars, one in red and orange and the other in blue and green, on a gray background.
The stars are meant to represent creativity and knowledge, while the gray background represents the real world. I hope this helps!"

## üìù Final Notes

If there are any bugs, please report them at [issues](https://github.com/Zoheb-Malik/BardieTS/issues/new) for visibility.

**Disclaimer:**
This package utilises a third-party API that interacts with Google's Bard API.
I have no affiliation with the creation of the endpoint (<https://bard.rizzy.eu.org>).
It is important to note that the usage of this package should ideally **not** be intended for commercial purposes or the provision of services for profit.
BardieTS should preferably be used along the lines of educational, research, or experimental purposes only.

**Special Thanks:**
I would like to extend a special thanks to [@rizzlogy](https://github.com/rizzlogy) for the original [bardie package](https://github.com/rizzlogy/bardie), which served as the inspiration for the development of this advanced TypeScript version.
This version aims to be accessible to a wide range of developers, making it easier for them to integrate AI interactions into their projects.

I would also like to thank [@underctrl-io](https://github.com/underctrl-io) for [their tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfdm-s8adI) on how to create and publish an npm package (the right way!)
